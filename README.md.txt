This is a basic RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR project that generates a random password
of given length.
This is somewhat different to other ones like this one. I have added a little block of code
so that you need not to click "enter" button every time , instead you need to just enter
the length and hit ENTER on your keyboard.

And you can copy the password generated to you clipboard too.
